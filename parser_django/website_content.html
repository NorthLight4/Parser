Being the UK's leading bike retailer allows us to stock an outstanding range of men's, women's and kids bikes in the latest designs from the likes of Boardman, Carrera, Voodoo, Apollo and many more top names. Our complete range covers all types of bikes, from  mountain bikes  for tackling the trails,  road bikes  for speed fenatics and  hybrid bikes  for city commuting. We also stock some of the UK's best electric bikes from the likes of Carrera, Apollo, Raleigh and Pendleton. Since electric mountain bikes and electric road bikes have become more readily available, it's easier to find an e-bike that suits your riding style and preferences. With an integrated electric motor, electric bikes provide a reliable solution for your daily commute. Folding electric bikes are a great option if you're commuting in and around the city with rucksacks or heavy luggage. The compact nature of these bikes means they are well-suited to busy journeys that feature public transport. If you're looking for a cycle shop near you, why not check out your local Halfords retail store?
At Halfords, we also take pride in our range of  kids bikes . It features some of the coolest designs from top brands such as Disney, Kiddimoto, Raleigh and Apollo. Our range includes boy's, girl's and unisex bikes for all age groups ranging from 2-10+ years. So if you're on the lookout for your child's first bike, you'll find colourful designs and familiar movie and TV characters that your kids will love. And because they're designed with little hands and feet in mind, most of our bikes feature stabilisers which can be removed once your son or daughter learns how to cycle.
Also, we stock a great selection of junior bikes which bring adult levels of comfort, safety and performance. Their lightweight alloy frame means they are excellent for transporting and loading in and out of vehicles. All bikes available online can be built by our team of experts at your  local Halfords store . Simply add the build when making a purchase and we'll take care of the rest. Alternatively, experience our trusted delivery service to get your bike delivered to your home or work. And to ensure you're fully fitted out your cycling adventure, check out our range of  cycling accessories . Still unsure which bike to choose? Head over to our  cycling help & advice  centre for buyers guides and videos.
 If you're still unsure which bike to choose, take a look through our  kids bike buyers guide  where you'll find important information and a size chart.
Alongside our huge range of bikes, we also stock everything you could need to keep your two wheels in shape. If you're looking to spruce up an old model or take your ride to the next level, then take a look through our range of bike parts, where you'll find shimano pedals, handlebars, bike wheels, brakes and more.
